#  Autonomous Greenhouse System

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Autonomous Greenhouse System developed by the Abdullah Gul University Department of Computer Engineering. The system integrates IoT technologies to create an intelligent greenhouse environment aimed at optimizing plant growth conditions.

## Features
Light Control: Dynamically adjusts internal lighting based on real-time environmental parameters.
Soil Moisture Regulation: Manages soil moisture levels and activates irrigation systems precisely when needed.
Water Reservoir Monitoring: Tracks water levels in the reservoir and alerts users in case of water scarcity.
Temperature and Humidity Control: Regulates internal conditions to foster an optimal growing environment.
Disease Status Monitoring: Utilizes machine learning models to detect plant diseases and alerts users via email.
## Technology Stack
Hardware: Arduino, Raspberry Pi 4, various sensors, actuators.
Software: Arduino code, Raspberry Pi functionalities, FastAPI, TensorFlow.
Web Integration: React.js frontend, Java/Spring API, Python/FastAPI API.
## Usage
Clone the repository.
Set up the hardware components according to the documentation.
Install the necessary dependencies for Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and APIs.
Run the software components and access the system via the web frontend.
